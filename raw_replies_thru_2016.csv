29789,@pollysgdaughter I already agreed she was wrong to do that. Why keep bringing up where we agree? Stick to what we disagree about.,Atagahi,pollysgdaughter
29790,@pollysgdaughter But not all. That's my point. We can't prove the negative for where we lack data. D/n matter where we do in that case.,Atagahi,pollysgdaughter
29791,@pollysgdaughter I think our racist society would consider her part black under the ODR. Passing was used by both Natives and Blacks though.,Atagahi,pollysgdaughter
29792,@pollysgdaughter Do you have lists for all who left in the many diasporas? How about those who left or stayed behind? Some not all?,Atagahi,pollysgdaughter
29793,"@pollysgdaughter No, it determines political identity/citizenship only. It can show heritage where we have the data but not where we don't.",Atagahi,pollysgdaughter
29794,"@pollysgdaughter Yes, the racist One Drop Rule is still used by the dominant society. Diff standard used for Natives to dispossess us.",Atagahi,pollysgdaughter
29795,"@pollysgdaughter It determines who is a Ch citizen, but not heritage. Too many holes in data we have to prove heritage claims definitively.",Atagahi,pollysgdaughter

29834,"@pollysgdaughter No, but she is more likely than Trump or R's to be an ally but not if we push her away permanently.",Atagahi,pollysgdaughter
29835,@pollysgdaughter Not my point. Point is that we have to be truthful or we lose credibility. Integrity is more important than short term win.,Atagahi,pollysgdaughter
29836,@pollysgdaughter And we discussed it thoroughly. She's not repeated it since then. Why let Trump bring up again?,Atagahi,pollysgdaughter
